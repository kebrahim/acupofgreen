      <span id="homeText">Acupuncture is based on the theory of the Five Elements, which are represented
      by this symbol.  The Five Elements (or Five Phases) are Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. They
      symbolize the natural balanced order of the universe and have countless correlations, both in
      nature and in our bodies.  When we understand and honor the order of the Five Phases, our lives
      will be more balanced and healthy.  Acupuncture and acupressure can help to create and maintain
      this balance.<br /><br/>
